## Clustering Algorithms - Unsupervised learning
1. Clustering based on Centroid-based algorithms (K-mean)
2. Clustering based on Density-based algorithms
3. Clustering based on Connectivity-based algorithms
4. Clustering based on Probability
5. Clustering based on Dimensionality Reduction
6. Clustering based on Deep Learning
